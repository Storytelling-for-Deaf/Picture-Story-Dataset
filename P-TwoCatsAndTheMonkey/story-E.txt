01- Once upon a time, there lived two cats near a village. They were close friends. They played together, slept together, and went everywhere together. 
02- Suddenly one day there was no food for both of them.
03- The two cats went in search of food, they found a loaf of bread. 
04- They both wanted the bread as they were very hungry. They began to fight over it. one cat said, “I found it first it’s mine.” Another cat said, “No I found it first, give it to me.” 
05- A monkey in the tree seeing them fighting said to himself, ‘It will be great if I get that bread. It looks yummy.”. 
06- He came to the cats and said, “Friends why are you quarreling? I will settle your fight”. Both the cats agreed to his proposal. 
07- The Monkey split the bread into two uneven pieces.
08- One piece was large and the other piece was small. Then he ate a portion from the larger piece.
09- But this made the other piece larger.
10- So it took a bite from the other piece. Similarly, the monkey ate the whole loaf of bread.
