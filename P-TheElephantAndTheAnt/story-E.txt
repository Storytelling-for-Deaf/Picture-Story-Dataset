01- Once upon a time, there lived a big elephant in the jungle. As the elephant was much bigger than all the other animals, he would always trouble them. 
02- In the same forest, there lived a family of ants. They were a hard-working family who always would go to gather food.
03- One day as they were walking big mean elephant threw water on them. The ant got angry.
04- The next day the ants noticed the sleeping elephant. The ant thought of teaching a lesson to the elephant.
05- She quietly climbed onto the elephant’s trunk and entered it. Once inside, she started biting the elephant.
06- The elephant shouted because of pain. He tried everything but couldn’t get the ant to stop biting him or come out of its trunk. The elephant pleaded to the ant to stop biting.
07- The ant stopped and said, “Well, I hope now you know how others will feel when you hurt them”. The elephant said, “Yes, I do! Please stop now”. The ant stopped and came out of its trunk. The elephant apologized to the ant and promised never to disturb others again.
