01- There was a river in a small village with a narrow bridge over it. 
02- People used the bridge to cross over the river. The bridge was so narrow that only one person could cross at a time. 
03- One day, two goats wanted to cross over the bridge from the opposite direction. The goats met in the middle of the bridge. 
04- The bridge was too narrow. There was no space for them to pass. They waited, but neither of them moved backward. 
05- One goat warned the other goat, “I am older and stronger than you, so go back once.” 
06- The other refused and said, “I am stronger. You are old and will take a lot of time to cross the bridge.”
07- Soon, their argument turned into a fight. One goat struck the other goat with his horns.
08- The second goat was shocked. He knew if they continued fighting, then they would fall off the bridge and drown. He shouted out to the other goat, “Stop! If we fight, we will fall into the river and drown. Instead, I shall lie down, and you may walk over me.” 
09- The wise goat then lay down on the bridge, and the other goat walked carefully over him.
10- So they finally went past each other and were on their way back home.
