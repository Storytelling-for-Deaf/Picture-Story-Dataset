1 - Aiman is a young girl. She wakes up in the morning. 
2 - She gets ready for school. I am Aiman's school bag. I am her friend. I watch her from my place in the corner of the room. I feel happy that I will also be going out soon.
3 - She carries me on her back when she leaves for school every morning.
4 - In the school bus, I sit comfortably on her lap. Aiman just loves me.
5 - I meet many other bags on our way to school. We chat and sign with each other.
6 - Aiman keeps many things inside me: colourful books, note books, eraser, pencils and her lunch box too. The lovely smell of food
comes from her lunch box.
7 - I am always with her.
8 - During the lunch break, she leaves me in the classroom. There are many other bags in the room. We all chat, laugh and sing. But i miss her. 
9 - When school is over, she quickly stuffs all her things into me and runs to bus. 
10 - She puts me in a corner after reaching home, and forgets all about me. I watch her from a distance.
