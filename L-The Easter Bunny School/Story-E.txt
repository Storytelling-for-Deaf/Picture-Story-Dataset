1 - All Easter Bunnies go to the Easter Bunny School, to learn the threemost important things.
2 - Painting Easter eggs: nice and bright.
3 - Hiding Easter eggs: not too hard, and not too easy.
4 - And, very important: reading maps.
5 - They must find good places to hide the eggs, and not get lost.
6 - Some children live in towns, some children in the country. Some children live in faraway places. 
7 - Our Easter Bunny is very new, and he must go to a BIG BIG PARK to hide eggs for the children playing in the park.
8 - "This map of this park isn't so easy." Easter Bunny turns the map around. "Water?" he puzzles. He asks a frog sitting by the
pool of water, "Is the BIG sandpit nearby?" Frog laughs. "No, but it isn't far. Just follow the path and ask the butterflies"
9 - Easter Bunny hops off, following the path. "Oh! The butterflies in the flower garden!"
10 - Easter Bunny stops, and the butterflies fly around his head. "Is the BIG sandpit nearby?" he asks.
11 - The Butterflies all laugh. "Follow the path and ask the BIG fish in the water." And they flutter back into their flowers.
     Easter Bunny hops off, following the path.
12 - "Oh, a BIG fish!" Easter Bunny stops near the water. "Is the BIG sandpit nearby?" he asks. The big fish in the water laughs. "Follow the path to the climbing playground. It isn't far." Easter Bunny hops off, following the path.
13 - Easter Bunny stops at the climbing playground. "Is the BIG sandpit nearby?" he asks from children. "Follow the path, it isn't far".
14 - He looks up and he sees the BIG sandpit at last, and the park keeper looking down at him.
15 - "You're late. The children will be here soon, so you'd better be quick hiding those eggs." "Sorry, but they gave me the wrong map."
16 - Easter Bunny starts to hide the bright coloured Easter eggs. The Park Keeper looks down at the map that Easter Bunny shows him.
17 - "But you are holding it upside down!" the Park Keeper laughs, very loud.
