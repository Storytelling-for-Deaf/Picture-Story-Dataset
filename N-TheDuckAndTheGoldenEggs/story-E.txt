1- Once upon a time there was a man who had a duck that laid golden eggs.

2- The countryman took the eggs to the market and sold them and started getting rich quickly.

3- But the duck was given only one golden egg per day so he did not get rich quickly. He was impatient about this.

4- One day, after he had finished counting his money, he had this idea. By killing the duck and cutting it open, you can get all the golden eggs at once.

5- But even though he tried to kill the duck like that, he did not find even one golden egg. His precious duck is also dead. In the end, he lost what he had. Everything was lost due to excessive greed.
