01- Once there was a big warehouse, where bags of rice were stored.   Many rats were living in the warehouse. 
02- There was a stray cat that often came to the warehouse for his food.
03- The cat would silently come there without any sound and chase after the rats and eat them.
04- Every day that cat comes and hunts down the rats. All the rats were very frightened and decided to have a meeting.
05- They all gathered together and started their discussion. The rats were very confused and couldn’t able to think of any solution to stop the cat. 
06- Suddenly a rat said, ” We should tie a bell around the cat’s neck”. If they tie a bell around the cat’s neck, the rats can hear the sound of the bell if the cat comes. 
07- Every rat thought that it was a great idea. But in the end, a rat asked “Who will tie the bell around the cat’s neck?”
