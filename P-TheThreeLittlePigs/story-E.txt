01- Once, the three little pigs left their home as it was time they built their own houses. The mother pig advised them to do their best.
02- The first pig took the easiest way and built a house of hay. 
03- The second pig built a house with sticks, which was a little stronger than the first one.
04- The third pig remembered his motherâ€™s advice and built a house with bricks.
05-  Soon, a wolf came by. He huffed and blew the hay house.
06- The pig ran to the stick house. The wolf huffed and puffed and the stick house also came down.
07- The two pigs ran to the brick house. The wolf huffed and puffed but the house remained intact.
08- The pigs knew that the wolf would enter through the chimney and kept a pot full of boiling water under it. The wolf fell right into the pot. The Burnt wolf ran away but the pigs learnt their lesson.
