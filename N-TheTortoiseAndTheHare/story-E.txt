1- A Hare was making fun of the Tortoise one day for being so slow. "Do you ever get anywhere?" he asked with a mocking laugh.

2- "Yes," replied the Tortoise, "and I get there sooner than you think. I'll run you a race and prove it."

3- The Hare was much amused at the idea of running a race with the Tortoise, but for the fun of the thing he agreed.

4- So the Fox, who had consented to act as judge, marked the distance and started the 
runners off.

5- The Hare was soon far out of sight.

6- Hare lay down beside the tree to take a nap until the Tortoise should catch up.

7- The Tortoise meanwhile kept going slowly but steadily, and, after a time, passed the 
place where the Hare was sleeping. 

8- But the Hare slept on very peacefully; and when at last he did wake up, the Tortoise 
was near the goal.

9- The Hare now ran his swiftest, but he could not overtake the Tortoise in time.

10- In the end the tortoise won the game.
