01- Once upon a time, there was a miser. He dug up a hole and buried all his gold under the tree in his garden.
02- Every day he went to the spot under the tree, dug it up, and looked at the gold happily. 
03- One day a thief saw the miser digging up and counting the gold. The thief waited till night to dig up the ground and took all the gold. 
04- The next day the miser came back to look at his gold, but he couldn’t find any gold in the pit.
05- Listening to the miser crying, the neighbours came running to his house. The miser showed them the hole and told them about the gold he hid under the tree. “Did you ever spend any of your gold?” asked one of the neighbours.
06- “No, I would only dig it up. Looking at it made me happy!” said the miser. ” You never used anything at all? The gold you had was of no use to you. Just look into the pit and assume that the gold is still inside it. So that you can be as happy as you were before.” said the neighbour.
