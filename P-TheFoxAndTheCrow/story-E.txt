01- Once upon a time there lived a cunning fox and a foolish crow in a forest.
02- One day the crow found a big piece of cheese and sat on a tree branch. The fox saw the crow sitting on the branch of the tree with a big piece of cheese in its mouth.
03- The fox is hungry. So the fox went to the crow and asked for the piece of cheese. The crow did not give the piece of cheese. But the fox did not give up.
04- The fox went back to the tree and said to the crow, "You are very handsome. Everyone in the forest is talking about you. They say your voice is very sweet. Can you sing a song for me?" The crow was happy to hear that and he forgot about the piece of cheese and started singing.
05- When the crow started singing, the piece of cheese fell from the tree and the fox caught it.
06- The stupid crow lost his cheese and sat alone on the tree and cried. The fox ran away with the piece of cheese.
