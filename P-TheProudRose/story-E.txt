01- Once upon a time, there was a rose that was very proud of her beautiful look. 
02- The only disappointment was that the rose grew next to an ugly cactus.
03- Every day the rose would insult the cactus on his looks, but the cactus stayed quiet.
04- Spring passed; summer came. There was no rain, the garden dried up and there was no water for the plants. 
05- The rose slowly began to lose its beautiful colour and started to wilt. 
06- Rose saw a sparrow dip its beak into the cactus and drank water from it.
07- The rose felt ashamed to ask for help from the cactus, but finally, it did ask. The kind cactus agreed happily. The sparrows watered the rose. They both became friends and got through the summer.
