1- My mother is angry with me, I don't know what to do.

2- I informed my friend and he came to help me.

3- My friend and I together thought of things that would make my mother happy.

4- Then we heard the sound of an owl. The owl was on the tree.

5- Then the owl said, "Your mother has a lot of work to do, and you are just adding more to her list."

6- When you eat, the sauce gets all over your body.

7- You play with her clothes even after you say it's wrong.

8- Your room is not always clean. Toys are everywhere. So your mom is not happy.

9- I listened to the owl and cleaned my room.
 
10- Now, my mother is happy. We read a book together.
