1- A country Maid was walking slowly along with a pail of milk upon her head.

2- She was saying to herself: “The money for which I shall sell this milk will buy me 
three hundred eggs.

3- These eggs will produce at least two hundred and fifty chickens.

4- The chickens will be fit to carry to market about Christmas, when poultry always brings a good price.

5- By May-day I shall have money enough to buy a new gown. Let me see—green suits me; yes, it shall be green.

6- In this dress I will go to the fair, where all the young fellows will want me for a partner. But I shall refuse every one of them.”

7- By this time she was so full of her fancy that she tossed her head proudly.

8- Over went the pail, and all the milk was spilled on the ground.
