1 - "It's magic," breathed Anna. "Let's catch it," said Will.
2 - So just before bedtime, they ran up the mound
3 - And leapt for the moon, pushed their feet off the ground.
4 - Their fingers clasped only the thin, empty air.
5 - So they climbed up a tree, tried to catch it from there.
6 - But as they climbed higher the moon sailed away.
7 - Further and further away did it stray 
8 - "We're tiny," frowned Anna. "We can't reach the sky."
9 - "So let's send our toys, all the ones that can fly."
10 - And up in the air whooshed their kite and balloon As they raced on their way to be first to the moon.
11 - The kite strings got tangled and twisted in trees.
12 - Their balloon disappeared, carried off by a breeze.
13 - And the children trudged home with a shrug and a sigh.
14 - "Let's build our own moon! Yes, that's what we'll do!" Beamed Will, grabbing cardboard, tinfoil and glue. They draw the moon.
15 - And lying upon it, they slept through the night Beneath the sky's twinkling blanket of light.
