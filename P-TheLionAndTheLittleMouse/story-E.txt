01- Once there was a lion resting under a tree.
02- A little mouse was playing in the forest. He jumped up to the lion's back and started to play. But lion did not get up.
03- Then the little mouse jumped up to the lion's head and started to play.  Lion got up with a loud roar. He was very angry. He caught mouse with his paws.
04- The little mouse was very scared. He said in a small voice, “I am sorry. Please don’t eat me. I was only playing. Please let me go. I shall always be your friend. Maybe one day I can help you.” The lion laughed. He said, “You are so small. How can you ever help a big lion like me?” Lion thought, “Anyway this mouse is too small to eat. I am also full. I will let him go.” So Lion put down the mouse.
05- A few days later, some hunters came to the forest. They spread out nets to catch animals. Lion was caught in a net. 
06- The title mouse saw lion caught in the net. He bit the net with his sharp teeth and slowly made a big hole in it. Lion came out of the net through the hole.
07- Lion thanked the little mouse and they became friends from that day.
