01- It was a beautiful spring day. A grasshopper was playing in a green grassy field. In that field,  a line of ants was marching along carrying some grains of wheat. The grasshopper asked, “ Where are you going with that big load?”.
02- “We are taking these grains to our nest,” said the Ant. “But it’s such a beautiful day, come and have fun with me,” said the grasshopper.
03- “No, I think you should come to work with us. It’s going to be a long winter with lots of snow. You had better start storing your food now” replied the ant.
04- “Why worry about the winter? It’s only spring, and there are lots of food everywhere,” said the grasshopper. The grasshopper did not listen to the ant. 
05- Then the summer came. Ants were busy collecting food for winter, but the grasshopper did nothing but eat, sleep, and play.
06- Later Autumn came. Ant advised the grasshopper to collect food for winter but he didn’t listen. 
07- A few weeks later, winter came, and the snow began to fall. Just as the ants said, the snow was very deep.
08- Ants were all warm and comfortable in their nest with lots of good food to eat. 
09- The grasshopper, however, had trouble finding food. He was very hungry and miserable cold all winter.  
10- By the time winter had ended, the grasshopper had learned a valuable lesson. Next spring onward, the grasshopper went out to gather food with the ant.
