1 - Blue skies and calm water - a perfect day for diving! We set out in a little boat.
2 - When we reached the dive site, we carefully checked all our equipments.
3 - When we were underwater, we saw a school of blue fish.
4 - There were soo many different fish around the large table coral.
5 - There were a bunch of yellow color fish.
6 - I took pictures of the fish.
7 - We came across a couple of sharks resting near the bottom. They're pretty harmless, so we swam in for a closer look.
8 - We followed this turtle for a while as he looked around the reef for a nice sea sponge to lunch on.
9 - What an incredible experience! I can't wait to go diving again!
