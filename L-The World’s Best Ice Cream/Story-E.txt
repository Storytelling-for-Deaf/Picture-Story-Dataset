1 - Angelina wanted ice-cream. But there were too many flavours to choose from.
2 - "What are your favourite foods?" said the ice-cream man. "Tell me and I will work out the best ice- cream for you."
3 - "Well," said Angelina. "I like sushi."
4 - "We don't have any ice-cream that tastes like sushi here," said the ice-cream man.
5 - "I also like buns."
6 - The ice-cream man looked. "No, nothing like buns- flavoured ice-cream either, I'm afraid," he said.
7 - "Well how about noodles?" No ...
    "Tomato sandwiches?" No ...
    "Grapes?"
8 - The ice-cream man looked up.
9 - "Grapes are close to blueberries ... "
10 - "No, I don't think it's the same" said Angelina.
11 - "They are both fruits. They are both purple," said the ice-cream man.
12 - Angelina just shook her head.
13 - "Well what about sausages?" said Angelina, brightening. "Or spaghetti? Oh! How about eggs on toast?
14 - But the ice-cream man didn't have any flavours like sausages, spaghetti or eggs on toast.
15 - "Pappadums?" No ...
     "Red beans?" No ...
     "Potatoes?" No ...
     "Chocolate?" No ...
16 - "Hang on," said the ice-cream man. "Did you say chocolate?"
17 - Angelina nodded. "Chocolate."
18 - "No," said the ice-cream man, looking disappointed. "We sold our last chocolate ice-cream yesterday."
19 - "How about I pick one for you?" said the ice-cream man, at last. "It will not taste like any of your favourite foods, but it will still taste nice."
20 - "Okay," said Angelina. She shut her eyes and counted to ten. When she opened them, the great big ice-cream was in front of her. It was a broccoli ice-cream, high as
a mountain.
