1 - It was evening. The birds were chirping and flying back to their nests.
2 - "Look, Akka! There's a butterfly on the bush!" said Putti. "A butterfly? Look again!" said Akka.
3 - They passed by Parvati's house. "Akka, look, Parvati's dog is wearing ponytails today!" said Putti.
    Akka giggled. "You funny girl! Look again!" she said.
4 - They walked past the big old Gulmohar tree. "Akka! A snake!" screamed Putti and clung to Akka.
    "Oh Putti, look again!" said Akka. "Haaaa!" said Putti, and relaxed.
5 - They passed by Raghav's house. "Akka, how did Raghav's mother's hair grow long so quickly? I saw her yesterday and she had short         hair!" said Putti. Akka laughed. "Putti, Putti, look again!"
6 - They went past the old library. "Ooooh Akka!" said Putti. "Have you ever seen such a big fruit on such a small plant?"
    "You're seeing things today, Putti!" Akka said, laughing and ruffling Putti's hair. "Look again!"
7 - "Walk faster, Putti, it's getting dark!" said Akka. "Eeeeeeeee! A monster!" shouted Putti. "Aw, look again, Putti!" said Akka.
    "Phhshhhhh!" sighed Putti, relieved.
8 - Putti and Akka reached home. "Look, Putti! Aren't these Ajji's slippers?" asked Akka.
9 - They peered in through the window. "Yes, Putti! Ajjiis here! She said she would bring chakli!" said Akka.
10 - "Look again, Putti!" said Akka. It WAS Ajji! And she had brought chakli!
