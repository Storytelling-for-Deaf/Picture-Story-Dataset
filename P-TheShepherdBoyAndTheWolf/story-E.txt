01- Once upon a time, there lived a shepherd boy who took care of sheep in a village. Every day he used to take the herd of sheep to the top of the hill and bring them down by evening. 
02- But one day he felt bored.  He decided to have some fun.  So he shouted loudly, “Here's a Wolf! Help me !”. The farmers in the neighbouring area heard the boy’s cries for help. All the villagers came to the top of the hill to save the sheep. 
03- The farmer asked the boy, “Wasn’t it you who cried for help ?”. The boy laughed and said, ” There is no wolf here. It was a joke.”
04- The next day the boy played the same trick and annoyed the farmers once again. A few days later, a wolf really came. 
05- The shepherd boy shouted for help. But no help came. Everybody thought that the stupid boy was again playing his childish joke.
06- The wolf killed many of the boy’s sheep. The boy felt sorry for his silly joke.
