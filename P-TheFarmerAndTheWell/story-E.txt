01- A farmer in a village was looking for a water source for his small farm. He bought a well from his neighbour.
02- The next day, the farmer came to draw water from his well. But the cunning neighbour refused to let the farmer take water. The farmer asked, “Why are you not letting me take water.” The neighbour replied, “I sold the well, not the water.”
03- The farmer didn’t know what to do. So, he went to the king to ask for justice.
04- The King called Birbal to solve the case. 
05- Birbal visited the neighbour and enquired him about the well. The cunning neighbour said the same thing again, ” I sold the well and not the water. So, he cannot use the water from my well.” Birbal replied, “As you have sold the well, you can’t keep your water in the well. Take the water out or use it all up. Or else, the water will belong to the farmer.” Realizing his cunning idea had failed him. He apologized and went home.
