1- There is a lady named Ms. McKay. There’s nobody else who is like her. She greets to all whom she passes by saying "Good day!".


2- Her hair is bright orange with two streaks of gray. And her purse may be made out of flowers and clay.

3- She had her house built in a tree by the bay, and there is a tire swing.

4- She’s famous for making a carrot soufflé.

5- She owns seven horses, and rides in a sleigh.

6- Her voice is quite bad but she sings everyday. If she’s holding her trumpet, don’t ask her to play!

7- I think you should meet her, as soon as today. Although, if you stop by she’ll insist that you stay.
