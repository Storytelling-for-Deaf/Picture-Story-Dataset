01- Once, there was a milkmaid who loved daydreaming about everything. She took good care of her cows on the farm, and the cows would give her fresh and creamy milk every day.
02- She used to milk her cow every day and sell the milk in the market. The Milkmaid carried her milk in a pail on her head to the market. As she was walking, she started daydreaming about the money she would be getting for selling the milk.
03- She thought, “I will buy fifty hens from the market. Once the hens lay eggs, I will sell them for money.” “With that money, I will buy a nice dress and wear it to the fair. Men will want to talk to me, and women will be jealous of me.” 
04- As she thought, she tipped on a stone and fell. The pail fell on the ground, and the milk spilled over her. The Milkmaid cried all the way back to the farm.
