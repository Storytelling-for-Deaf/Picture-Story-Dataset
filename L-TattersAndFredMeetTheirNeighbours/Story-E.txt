1 - It was a beautiful, warm summer's day. The sun was shining and there were gentle breezes blowing through the air.
2 - Two goldfish named Tatters and Fred were playing their favorite game of tag in the creek where they lived.
3 - They looked up to see someone sitting on a flower by the side of the creek. They swam closer to ask, "Who are you?"
    "Why, I am a bumblebee," their new friend buzzed, "and I like flowers." "How very nice," the goldfish replied, then went on their way      to continue with their game.
4 - Later in the morning, they noticed someone sprawled on a log. "Well, hello!" said Tatters and Fred. "We're playing a game. Would you    like to join us?" "No thanks," drawled the turtle. "When the sun is out, I like to rest and enjoy the warmth on my back."
"Okay," said Tatters and Fred.
5 -They glanced skyward to see someone perched in a tree beside the creek. They said hello and the songbird chirped, "Good afternoon! I've enjoyed watching you play your game. I am singing a cheerful song because you've made me happy!"
"Your singing is beautiful; thank you!" replied Tatters and Fred before they swam away.
6 - They saw a butterfly. "I like to flit and float about in the gentle breezes" Butterfly said.  Tatters and Fred agreed, saying, "That looks like fun! We enjoy swimming in the water since we can't fly."
7 - They watched a frog swim back to the edge of the creek. "That felt so refreshing," croaked the frog. "I needed to cool off!"
8 - Just before bedtime, Tatters and Fred enjoyed watching a dragonfly zip and zap above the surface of the water.
    "Good night,"said the dragonfly. "Good night," said Tatters and Fred.
    Time for bed!
9 - And they dreamed of which favorite game they would play tomorrow.
