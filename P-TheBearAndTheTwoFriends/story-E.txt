01- Nimal and Kamal were good friends. One day they were passing through a forest.
02- On their way, they saw a bear coming towards them.
03- Nimal ran and climbed up a nearby tree.
04- Kamal did not know the skill of climbing a tree. But he showed the presence of mind. He had heard that wild animals do not hurt dead bodies. 
05- So he lay down still on the ground. He closed his eyes and held back his breath. The bear came to Kamal.
06- He sniffed Kamal’s Ears. He thought that the man was dead and went away.
07- When the bear was out of sight, Nimal climbed down the tree. He went to Kamal and asked, “What did the bear tell you into your ear?”. Kamal said, “The Bear told me to keep away from a selfish friend like you”.
