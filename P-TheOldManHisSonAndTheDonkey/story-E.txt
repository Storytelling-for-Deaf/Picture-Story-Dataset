01- A long time ago, an old man and his Son had an Donkey.  The Donkey was quite old and could not work anymore. They decided to take the Donkey to the village fair and sell him.
02- The next day, they took the donkey and started walking towards the fair. As they were walking someone from the village laughed loudly at them saying, “Look at them. They have an donkey and still, they are walking. What is the use of such a donkey?”. On hearing this, old man asked his son to sit on his donkey and started walking himself.
03- They had gone a little further along the road, and they heard three merchants whispering, “Oh see! The son is cruel. He is comfortably riding the donkey while his old father walks this long distance. He should be ashamed of himself.” The son felt guilty. He got down from the donkey and asked his father to sit instead, just to please the merchants.
04- Further, along the way, they met some women carrying market baskets. They asked the old man, “Why are you riding the donkey while your son walks? The donkey looks strong enough. Why don’t you both sit on the donkey?”. The old man took their suggestion and both the old man and the son started riding the donkey.
05- Sometimes later, a group of people on the road remarked, “Look at the poor donkey! So much burden on his shoulder”. The old man and son felt sad for the donkey. They tied the donkey’s legs to a pole and carried him.
06- When they reached the market everyone in the village burst into laughter at this site. Even the donkey was embarrassed.
07- The donkey began to kick, and he tried to pull away to free himself from the rope. Just as they were crossing a bridge, he moved side to side and accidentally fell into the river.
08- By trying to please everybody, he had pleased nobody and lost his donkey forever.
