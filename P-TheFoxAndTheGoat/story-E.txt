01- One day, a fox was roaming in the jungle. It was a hot summer day. The fox was extremely thirsty but could not find any water. 
02- He kept on walking and suddenly he saw a well. 
03- He leaped on the well’s wall to check the water, he lost his balance and fell right into the well. The well was very deep, and the fox didn’t know how to get out of the well. 
04- He got really scared and screamed for help. Nearby the goat was passing the well.
05- When goat heard the fox, goat went to peep inside the well. The goat saw the fox and asked, “What are you doing inside the well?”. The fox said, "I just came into this well to cool myself off". 
06- The fox asked the goat to come into the well. Not even thinking for a second, the goat jumped into the well. 
07- The goat enjoyed the cold water and drank. 
08- After some time, the goat stops and asks the fox ” How are we going to get out of this well?”. The fox replied, “If you stand on your two feet and push me up I can manage to reach the top of the well and get out, after that, I will get you out”. 
09- The goat once again without thinking twice does as the fox said. The fox got out. 
10- The goat asked, “What about me? How would I get out?”. The fox said “I guess you have to think about it on your own” and the fox left the place.
