01- Once upon a time, there lived a baby crocodile. He had a beautiful, shiny tail. The other crocodiles were very jealous of him and did not play with him.
02- The baby Crocodile was very lonely and very sad. One day he thought, 'I have these beautiful scales on my tail but the crocodiles don't. I can give away scales to all of them and make them happy. Then they will be my friends' The next day the baby crocodiles waited by the river bank.
03- When the other crocodiles came to bathe in the river, baby  crocodile said, "Brothers, I have a wonderful idea. I will give each of you some scales from my tail. Will you then be my friend?‚Äù The other crocodiles were amazed at the baby crocodile's generosity. They felt ashamed of their behavior and promised to include him in their play.
